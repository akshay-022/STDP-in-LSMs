# STDP-in-LSMs

The file Lyon_BSA_encoding_2.ipynb contains the code to create the spikes dataset from the Google mini-speech dataset.
The dataset contains 8 commands, which we wish that our LSM and learning rules can learn to classify.

The file LSM_supervised-2.ipynb contains code to initialize the LSM and run various kinds of STDP on it. This includes unsupervised and supervised STDP with the help of a teacher signal.
